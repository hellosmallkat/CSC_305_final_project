## A/B Test 1
A/B Test Name: Trend Analysis Chart Preference

User Story Number: US4

Metric (from the HEART grid): Adoption/Happiness 

Hypothesis: The problem we want to solve is improving user adoption for our spending categories app. 
            Adoption refers to how effectively users engage with and utilize the app. We need to identify 
            where users drop off the most in the conversion funnel to narrow down the problem. Specifically, 
            weâ€™ll focus on the categories analysis page. This experiment aims to determine if one type of 
            graph is more received than others and if that can improve adoption rate and happiness. Perhaps 
            there is a bottleneck in that people do not visit the trends page or visit it once and do not 
            come back. This could be the result of the chart not being appealing. This experiment aims to fix that.
            
Experiment: To visualize the data related to our hypothesis, we can consider the following chart types as experiments:
            Bar Chart, Doughnut Chart, and Pie Chart. A small group of users will each get one of the graphs 
            that showcase the same data but in different charts. After a small window of time, the graph that showcases 
            the data will change and this will continue until all users have had each graph. A survey will then be sent 
            out asking which graph was received best. Analytics will also be collected to check if there is a change in
            the number of users online for each graph to see if one is more well-received than the others.
            
Variations: The variations are as mentioned, the different types of charts. The actual data the charts are displaying will
            be the same: categories and the total spent in each. 
            
            Pie Chart: the pie chart will have each slice be represented by a category (different colored slice labels in a key 
            at the top) that show what percent of the budget is spent on each category
            
            Bar Chart: The bar chart will have, on the y-axis, the amount spent with the max being the budget and the y-axis
            will be the categories. The individual bars will be the total spent on each category so the relation between them 
            and the total budget can be seen.
            
            Doughnut Chart: This chart will be similar to the pie chart in that is represented in percentages but the center is
            cut out and may be more appealing to the users

## A/B Test 2:

A/B Test Name: Account Balance Visibility

User Story Number: US3

Metric (from the HEART grid): Daily active user

Hypothesis: We hypothesize that by prominently displaying the user's account balance on the home screen of our financial app, 
we will observe an increase in daily active users. Our analysis suggests that users often visit the app to check their account balances,
but this information is not immediately visible upon opening the app. By providing instant access to account balances without the need 
for additional navigation, we expect to improve user engagement and retention. This hypothesis is based on the understanding that 
easy access to essential financial information is crucial for users, and optimizing its visibility could lead to a higher frequency of 
app usage and overall daily activity.

Experiment:
We will conduct an A/B test where Group A will see the current app interface without the account balance displayed on the home screen,
while Group B will see an updated version of the app with the account balance prominently displayed at the top of the home screen. 
Both groups will consist of randomly selected users from our active user base. We will track the daily active users in each group over 
a period of two weeks to analyze any changes in user engagement. At the end of the experiment, we will compare the daily active user 
metrics between the two groups to determine the impact of displaying the account balance on the home screen.
