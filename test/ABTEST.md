## A/B Test 1
A/B Test Name: Trend Analysis Chart Preference

User Story Number: US4

Metric (from the HEART grid): Adoption/Happiness 

Hypothesis: The problem we want to solve is improving user adoption for our spending categories app. 
            Adoption refers to how effectively users engage with and utilize the app. We need to identify 
            where users drop off the most in the conversion funnel to narrow down the problem. Specifically, 
            weâ€™ll focus on the categories analysis page. This experiment aims to determine if one type of 
            graph is more received than others and if that can improve adoption rate and happiness. Perhaps 
            there is a bottleneck in that people do not visit the trends page or visit it once and do not 
            come back. This could be the result of the chart not being appealing. This experiment aims to fix that.
            
Experiment: To visualize the data related to our hypothesis, we can consider the following chart types as experiments:
            Bar Chart, Doughnut Chart, and Pie Chart. A small group of users will each get one of the graphs 
            that showcase the same data but in different charts. After a small window of time, the graph that showcases 
            the data will change and this will continue until all users have had each graph. A survey will then be sent 
            out asking which graph was received best. Analytics will also be collected to check if there is a change in
            the number of users online for each graph to see if one is more well-received than the others.
            
Variations: The variations are as mentioned, the different types of charts. The actual data the charts are displaying will
            be the same: categories and the total spent in each. 
            
            Pie Chart: the pie chart will have each slice be represented by a category (different colored slice labels in a key 
            at the top) that show what percent of the budget is spent on each category
            
            Bar Chart: The bar chart will have, on the y-axis, the amount spent with the max being the budget and the y-axis
            will be the categories. The individual bars will be the total spent on each category so the relation between them 
            and the total budget can be seen.
            
            Doughnut Chart: This chart will be similar to the pie chart in that is represented in percentages but the center is
            cut out and may be more appealing to the users
