Metric 1: NPS
* This metric will be gathered by a screen on the app that asks the user how likely they would be to
  recommend this app to a friend or colleague. This metric would then be stored under the users' data
  in the database so their responses can be recorded and an average can be determined.

Metric 2: App Rating
* This metric will be measured by a screen on the app that asks the user to rate the app and by getting the
  average, an idea of how well the app is received can be derived. This metric would then be stored under the users' data
  in the database so their responses can be recorded and an average can be determined.

Metric 3: Daily active users

* This metric will be used to gain the amount of daily active users and how long the user is online. 
  This metric can be tracked by using the backend server to track the login date and time. Also the login out date/time of the user.

Metric 4: Adoption
* This metric will be measured by how many users download the application. We will monitor this in our backend by keeping track of app installations.

Metric 5: Retention
* This metric will be measured by monthly active users and daily active users. We will be keeping track
  of this metric using the FireBase backend. It is located in the authentication tab under the usage.
  This accurately logs all the retention metrics for us.
